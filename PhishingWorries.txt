That is a very normal thing to be worried about! But just remember: if the scammers tell you that there is suspicious activity on your device? there probably isn't any. Don't give out your information to any email (remember: most companies know who you are and have your information already). If you don't recognize something (like an invoice) in the email, then it is also most likely a scam (Federal Trade Commision, 2019).
